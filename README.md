Events based site for Developers to meet up (Covid appropriate) - goal to use nextjs best practices while building a potentially useful project<br>
Plan<br>
<br>
Routing<br>
-Starting page showing featured events (/)<br>
-Events page showing all events; user clicks on event and finds out more info about that event, potentially sign up and book the event(/events); leads on to dynamic events detail page<br>
-Event detail page showing the selected event(/events/<some-id>)<br>
-Page showing filtered events by year and month(/events/...slug)<br>
<br>
Styling<br>
-Will use module based CSS styling for this project, due to ease of use with nextjs, easy to find and track individual components styling<br>
